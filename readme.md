# Tetris using Gosu

There's not a lot to say... It's Tetris done with the Ruby
[Gosu](http:http://www.libgosu.org/) Library.

## Updated in this version

Added more colours and the other shape that I forgot :-) The colours are more varied
too, it's still random but it will no longer return the same colour twice in a row.

Added pausing.

## TODO

Moving left and right can go through already-dropped blocks.

Check for the game being finished because there is a block in the top row.

Dialog after completion.

## Controls

Use the left and right arrows to move the shapes left and right.

The up arrow rotates the piece.

The down arrow speeds the shape downward.

R   Restarts

P   Pauses

Esc Exits
