# Tetris using Gosu

There's not a lot to say... It's Tetris done with the Ruby
[Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/) Library.

## Updated in this version

Detection of the game being over because there is a block in the top row and
an ensuing dialog.

The game background is now a static graphic due to my Mac being fixed, Yay!

## TODO

Check for rotation being possible before doing it.

Rotation around a point that isn't the top-left corner for some rotations
for some shapes.

## Controls

Use the left and right arrows to move the shapes left and right.

The up arrow rotates the piece.

The down arrow speeds the shape downward.

R   Restarts

P   Pauses

Esc Exits
