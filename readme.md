# Tetris using Gosu

There's not a lot to say... It's Tetris done with the Ruby
[Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/) Library.

## Updated in this version

Added the two snake / stair shapes. I only realised that there was something 
missing because I did a crossword with the clue 'Game played with 7 pieces'
for Tetris and I thought 'Seven? I only have five, hmm...'. 
Earlier, I looked at Tris on my iPhone and saw the missing pieces.

Potential rotation is checked before performing it now.

## TODO

Rotation around a point that isn't the top-left corner for some rotations
for some shapes.

## Controls

Use the left and right arrows to move the shapes left and right.

The up arrow rotates the piece.

The down arrow speeds the shape downward.

R   Restarts

P   Pauses

Esc Exits
